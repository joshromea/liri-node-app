# liri-node-app-

LIRI is a language interpretation and Recognition Interface that utilizes Node to interperate certain tasks and searches.

# How-To

You will need to first clone this repo. Next, you will open terminal/bash on your computer and enter `npm install`.

# Starting out

You will need to open the file `liri.js` in your terminal. Once there you enter the commands "node liri.js <Task> <Search>".
If you forget to add a task and search, don't worry! The terminal will give you friendly instructions on what to enter.

# Tasks

Liri has 3 main tasks it can perform. It can:

`spotify-this`:
It will take your search term (i.e. song, artist) and find results according to your search. It will list out the Artist, Song Name, Album Title and even a snippet of the song via URL. 
If you happen to just type `spotify-this` alone, don't fret; it will still return a default song for you.

`movie-this`:
This will take your search term (movie title) and find results according to your search. It will print out the Movie title, Release year, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes Rating, Country of Origin, Language, Actors, and Plot.

`do-what-it-says`:
With the repo, there is a `random.txt` file. This function will take what is in there and do the specific function to get the results you are looking for.
